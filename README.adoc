== How we use tools

=== Weighted iterative GNPS analog search (WIGAS)

=== Sirius
Sirius annotations were performed in batch mode by using Sirius 6. we utilized the \textit{ConfidenceScoreExact} measure.
Unfortunately, in some cases, Sirius was not able to propose an annotation. To remedy, we associated a value of 0.5 to Sirius matching score. Additionally, in scenarios where there is no match with GNPS or no match with Sirius, the tanimoto between GNPS and SIRIUS cannot be calculated. Hence, a default value of 0.25 was also assigned to $T_{gs}$ in these instances. 

=== ISDB-LOTUS
For ISDB-Lotus, since a strict library search was applied, we considered a zero answer as an important information regarding our definition of novelty. Hence, no mean value was associated.

== Validation

=== Manufactured case
With our function in hand, we first opted to assess the ability of MS2Decide to recommend new NPs among a chemodiverse spectral library of 90 known compounds and 6 unreported ones.

=== Real case
In our second case study, MS2Decide was applied to assess its ability to streamline the discovery of new NPS from the LC-MS/MS analysis of the alkaloidic extract of a well known monoterpene indole alkaloids-producing plant, \textit{Pleiocarpa mutica} Benth.\ (Apocynaceae).
