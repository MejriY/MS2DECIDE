Mass spectrometry-based natural products targeted discovery often relies on a complicated decision-making process involving tedious comparison of exact masses data and tandem mass spectra-based annotation tools outputs against various spectral reference libraries.
To address this bottleneck we present tandem mass spectrum to decision(MS2DECIDE) which leverages Decision Theory and expert knowledge to aggregate the annotation outputs of GNPS, Sirius, and ISDB-LOTUS and computes a recommendation for targeting natural products inregard to their potential novelty. We demonstrate, through two cases tudies, that MS2DECIDE reliably captures the novelty of naturalproducts from their tandem mass spectra.

== How we use tools
=== Weighted iterative GNPS analog search (WIGAS)

=== Sirius
Sirius annotations were performed in batch mode by using Sirius 6. we utilized the \textit{ConfidenceScoreExact} measure.
Unfortunately, in some cases, Sirius was not able to propose an annotation. To remedy, we associated a value of 0.5 to Sirius matching score. Additionally, in scenarios where there is no match with GNPS or no match with Sirius, the tanimoto between GNPS and SIRIUS cannot be calculated. Hence, a default value of 0.25 was also assigned to $T_{gs}$ in these instances. 

=== ISDB-LOTUS
For ISDB-Lotus, since a strict library search was applied, we considered a zero answer as an important information regarding our definition of novelty. Hence, no mean value was associated.

== Validation

=== Manufactured case
With our function in hand, we first opted to assess the ability of MS2Decide to recommend new NPs among a chemodiverse spectral library of 90 known compounds and 6 unreported ones.

=== Real case
In our second case study, MS2Decide was applied to assess its ability to streamline the discovery of new NPS from the LC-MS/MS analysis of the alkaloidic extract of a well known monoterpene indole alkaloids-producing plant, \textit{Pleiocarpa mutica} Benth.\ (Apocynaceae).
