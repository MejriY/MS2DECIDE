Mass spectrometry-based natural products targeted discovery oftenrelies on a complicated decision-making process involving tediouscomparison of exact masses data and tandemmassspectra-based annotation tools outputs against various spectral reference libraries.
Toaddress this bottleneck we present tandem mass spectrum to decision(MS2DECIDE) which leverages Decision Theory and expert knowledgeto aggregate the annotation outputs of GNPS, Sirius, and ISDB-Lotusand computes a recommendation for targeting natural products inregard to their potential novelty. We demonstrate, through two casestudies, that MS2DECIDE reliably captures the novelty of naturalproducts from their tandem mass spectra.
