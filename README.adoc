MS2DECIDE is a Python library that leverages decision theory to assist chemists in natural products annotation and targeting. By gathering insights from domain experts and modeling their intuition, the library offers a structured, data-driven approach to interpreting multiannotated tandem mass spectrometry data. MS2DECIDE integrates GNPS (enhanced with a weighted iterative analog search), ISDB-LOTUS and Sirius6 annotations to deliver reliable recommendation even in uncertain scenarios. This library bridges expert knowledge and computational efficiency, simplifying complex workflows and enabling chemists to make informed, confident decisions in metabolite research.

== Installation
You can install **MS2DECIDE** using either `pip` (recommended for most users) or `conda`. Follow the instructions below based on your preferred method:

**Ensure Python is installed**  
   Before proceeding, make sure Python (version 3.7 or higher) is installed on your system. You can download it from https://www.python.org/downloads/.  
   - On Windows: Install Python and check the box to add it to your system's PATH.
   - On Mac/Linux: Python is often pre-installed, but ensure it's the correct version by running:

[source,console]
----
python3 --version
----

Alternatively, you can use **Conda**, which includes Python. Download and install Conda from https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/.

**Set up a virtual environment**  
   Create an isolated environment using either `venv` or `conda`.

**Using venv (pip):**

[source,console]
----
python3 -m venv ms2decide_env
source ms2decide_env/bin/activate  // On Windows: ms2decide_env\Scripts\activate
----

**Using Conda:**

[source,console]
----
conda create --name ms2decide_env python=3.7
conda activate ms2decide_env
----

**Install the library**  
   You can install it using `pip` by replacing `MS2DECIDE_Folder` with the actual path to the folder:

[source,console]
----
pip install 'MS2DECIDE_Folder'.
----

   If you are installing from a GitHub repository, use:

[source,console]
----
pip install git+https://github.com/MejriY/MS2DECIDE.git
----

**Verify the installation**  
   Check if the library is installed successfully:

[source,console]
----
python -c "import ms2decide; print('MS2DECIDE installed successfully!')"
----

== How do we face tools inhability to annotate

=== GNPS
In scenarios where there is no match with GNPS or no match with Sirius, the tanimoto between GNPS and Sirius cannot be calculated. Hence, a default value of 0.25 was assigned to $T_{gs}$ in these instances.

=== Sirius
Sirius annotations were performed in batch mode by using Sirius 6. we utilized the Confidence Approximate score. Unfortunately, in some cases, Sirius was not able to propose an annotation. To remedy, we associated a value of 0.5 to Sirius matching score.

=== ISDB-LOTUS
For ISDB-LOTUS, since a strict library search was applied (0.02 Da), we considered a zero answer as an important information regarding our definition of novelty. Hence, no mean value was associated.
