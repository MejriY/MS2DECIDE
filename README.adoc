MS2DECIDE is a Python library that leverages decision theory to assist chemists in natural products multiannotation and prioritization. By gathering insights from domain experts and modeling their intuition, the library offers a structured, data-driven approach to interpreting multiannotated tandem mass spectrometry data. MS2DECIDE integrates GNPS (enhanced with a iterative weighted analog search), ISDB-LOTUS and Sirius6 annotations to deliver reliable recommendation even in uncertain scenarios. This library bridges expert knowledge and computational efficiency, simplifying complex workflows and enabling chemists to make informed, confident decisions in natural products discovery.

## Usage Guide: `K_estimation`

The `K_estimation` function is a core feature of `ms2decide`, designed to aggregate annotations from multiannotation tools as GNPS, ISDB-LOTUS, and Sirius by leveraging decision theory. This approach models expert preference elicitation to derive \( K \)-values for features prioritization, providing a unified and informed annotation estimate.

---

### **Overview**
The `K_estimation` function:

- Integrates annotation data from multiple sources: GNPS, ISDB-LOTUS, and Sirius.

image::https://github.com/MejriY/Decide_test/raw/master/image/who%20it%20work.png[]

- Processes user-provided input files such as quantitative data and MGF files.

- Generates a filtered dataframe based on the estimated \( K \)-values.

- Exports the results into a `.tsv` file for further analysis.

---

### **How to Use `K_estimation`**

**Below is an example of how to call the `K_estimation` function in Python and interact with its prompts:**

```python
from ms2decide.K_estimation import K_estimation

K_estimation()
```
**Input credentials**
   - The function will prompt you to provide your GNPS username, password, and email. This is necessary for authenticating on the GNPS platform.

**Provide Input Files**

### **Notes**
- Ensure that your input files follow the required format (`.csv` for quantitative data, `.mgf` for mass spectrometry data). If you use the export file module of MZmine (>2.53) for FBMN, the format will be accepted.
- Ensure that you have your Sirius identification file (annotation file) related to your data.
- Ensure internet connectivity for accessing GNPS and related services.
- The save path for the `.tsv` file must have a valid `.tsv` extension and specify the desired file name (e.g., `/path/to/output_file.tsv`).

By following these steps, you can effectively use the `K_estimation` function to process and analyze your compound data.
Specify the paths to the following required files:
    
- **Quantitative Table File**: A `.csv` file containing the quantitative data for your analysis. Ensure the file format is correct to avoid errors.
   
- **MGF File**: A file containing tandem mass spectrometry data in MGF format.
    
  
- Example paths:

     ```plaintext
     SELECT THE PATH FOR YOUR QUANTITATIVE FILE. This path needs to terminate with a *.csv at the end 
     : /path/to/quantitative_file.csv

     SELECT THE PATH FOR YOUR MGF FILE.  This path needs to terminate with a *.mgf at the end 
     : /path/to/mgf_file.mgf
     ```

**Setup GNPS Workflow**

   - **FBMN Title:** Provide a unique and descriptive title for your FBMN job. 

**Note**: A folder with this title will be created to upload the quantitative data and MGF files. Ensure the title you choose does not match the name of an existing folder.
  
- Choose the type of GNPS library search:
           - `strict`: Uses a typical mass difference tolerance of 0.02 Da and threshold value of 0.001. For more precise information, we recommend visiting the [GNPS Documentation on Library Search](https://ccms-ucsd.github.io/GNPSDocumentation/librarysearch/). 

**Note**: Since, this workflow uses a library score threshold of `0.001` some failures can occur with the FBMN GNPS workflow. We recommend to increase the threshold value (for e.g., 0.1) in the MS2DECIDE source code (line 123 in the file ClosestGNPS.py) or to report the failure to the GNPS staff.
     
       - `iterative`: for iterative weighted analog search (can take up to three hours).

**Note**: with iterative 27 FBMN jobs will be launched from your GNPS account. In the case of `strict`, only one job will be launched.

**ISDB-LOTUS Annotation**

The ISDB-LOTUS annotation is performed using the function `isdb_res = get_cfm_annotation(mgf, ISDBtol)`. During the process, the user will be prompted to choose:
    
- **Ionization Mode**: Specify the ionization mode for annotation (`POS` for positive, `NEG` for negative).
    
- **Mass Tolerance**: Provide a mass tolerance value less than `0.5` (default: `0.02`). **Note**: This value is comprised between 0 and 0.5.
   
**Note**: This function calculates annotations by matching mass spectrometry data against ISDB-LOTUS spectral data accessible [here](https://zenodo.org/records/8287341)

**Sirius Annotation**

- Provide the path to the Sirius 6 annotation file (`structure_identifications.tsv`)

   ```plaintext
     SELECT THE PATH FOR YOUR SIRIUS6 ANNOTATION FILE. 
     #This path needs to terminate with structure_identifications.tsv at the end.
     ```

Select the confidence score type: 

     - `exact`

     - `approximate`

**Note**: For more information on this choice, see the [SIRIUS documentation](https://v6.docs.sirius-ms.io/methods-background/#confidence-score-modes)


**Compile Annotations and export Results**

- Annotations from GNPS, Sirius, and ISDB-LOTUS are compiled into a unified dataframe.

- The dataframe is filtered and sorted by \( K \)-values.

- Specify the path to save the output `.tsv` file:

     ```plaintext
     SELECT THE SAVE PATH FOR THE .TSV FILE OF MS2DECIDE OUTPUT. 
     #This path needs to terminate with a file_name.tsv where `file_name` is the desired name specified by the user.
     ```

**Optional: Retrieve Empty Annotations in the case of iterative weighted GNPS analog search**

- If requested (`yes`), the function generates a report of empty annotations and saves it as `empty.tsv`. This could help to complete missing InChIs or SMILES of existing MS/MS spectra on the GNPS.

---

### **Return Value**
The function returns a (`tsv file`)containing the **processed** and **ranked** results.

By following these steps, you can effectively use the `K_estimation` function to process and aggregate your multiannotated MS/MS spectra. In combination with FBMN data you can upload the K.tsv on your graph program and map with a continuous color code the ranks proposed by the knownness score K. 

== How do we face tools inability to annotate

=== GNPS
In scenarios where there is no match with GNPS or no match with Sirius, the tanimoto between GNPS and Sirius cannot be calculated. Hence, a default value of 0.7 was assigned to $T_{gs}$ and $T_{gi}$ in these instances.

=== Sirius
Sirius annotations were performed in batch mode by using Sirius 6. we utilized the Confidence Approximate score. Unfortunately, in some cases, Sirius was not able to propose an annotation. To remedy, we associated a value of 0.5 to Sirius matching score.

=== ISDB-LOTUS
For ISDB-LOTUS, since a strict library search was applied (0.02 Da), we considered a zero answer as an important information regarding our definition of novelty. Hence, no mean value was associated.
