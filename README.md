# MS2DECIDE

Mass spectrometry-based natural products targeted discovery often relies on a complicated decision-making process involving tedious comparison of exact masses data and tandem mass spectra-based annotation tools outputs against various spectral reference libraries.
To address this bottleneck we present tandem mass spectrum to decision(MS2DECIDE) which leverages Decision Theory and expert knowledge to aggregate the annotation outputs of GNPS, Sirius, and ISDB-LOTUS and computes a recommendation for targeting natural products inregard to their potential novelty. We demonstrate, through two cases tudies, that MS2DECIDE reliably captures the novelty of naturalproducts from their tandem mass spectra.
